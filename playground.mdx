## Speed Performances

We made many updates to improve the overall speed for your OpenAPI pages and update workflows:

- For large projects (~3,000 files), the download step for docs updates is now ~440x faster - a 99.8% time reduction. Across the board, file downloads during updates are now ~5.5x faster - an 81.8% time reduction.

- For API reference pages with complex data types, we've drastically reduced the size of the page. For customers with complex, recursive OpenAPI data types, this means a size reduction of up to 98%.

## JWT Auth

We polished the UI with new icons and a new layout.

## File Uploads in API Playground

By default, API playground requests are proxied by Mintlify. Now you can use `disableProxy` to disable this behavior and support request types like file uploads.

- [Learn more about API configurations](/settings/global#api-configurations)

## More

- **Troubleshooting for API pages**: API pages could be complicated so we listed common issues to help you sort them out quickly — [Read the docs](/api-playground/troubleshooting)

---

- **Google Fonts Support**: We now support more fonts with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). We're introducing the `font` object so you can apply custom fonts to your docs and specific elements in the `mint.json` file — including font weights and styles. See example below:
```
"font": {
  "headings": "Oswald",
  "body": "Roboto"
}
``` 
<Info>
  If empty, we default to the [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) font family.
</Info>

- **Advanced Footer**: Now you can update the standard footer with more context — i.e. links. The new `footer` object lets you set links in your `mint.json` file for quick access to your social accounts, landing pages, or, funnier, your legal terms.

- **GitLab Switcher** `Enterprise`: We just made the switch from GitHub to GitLab as simple as a click. Go to [your settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings) to get started.
