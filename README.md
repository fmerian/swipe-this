# swipe-this

This repository is my personal collection of marketing, growth, and UX ideas.

It includes pages, onboarding flows, docs, ads, and product updates from awesome dev tools like Resend, Stripe, Vercel, and more. So, if I'm struggling with creative work, I can refer to it for inspiration.

**Do you have any suggestions? Awesome! Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/fmerian/swipe-this/issues) or [open a Pull Request](https://github.com/fmerian/swipe-this/pulls).**

## stack

This collection is generated using [mintlify/starter](https://git.new/docs).

### Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview changes locally. To install it, use the following command:

```
npm i -g mintlify
```

Run the following command at the root (where mint.json is)

```
mintlify dev
```

### publishing changes

Install the Mintlify Github App to auto propagate changes from your repo to your deployment. Changes will be deployed to production automatically after pushing to the `main` branch. Find the link to install on your dashboard. 

**troubleshooting**

- `mintlify dev` isn't running? Run `mintlify install` — it will re-install dependencies.
- Page loads as a 404? Make sure you're running in the folder with `mint.json`.
