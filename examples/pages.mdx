## Axiom's Competitor-focused Headline

In a crowded space, one common objection when landing on a home page is how your product differentiates from alternatives. Axiom puts it upfront. The ATF section stands out with a bold, explicit statement.

## Metomic's Persona-oriented Logo Cloud

Problem with logo clouds: You may not know them. As a workaround, Metomic's logo cloud features customers and a short description of the companies.

## Mintlify's Wall of Love

When others highlight a few quotes from well-known companies, Mintlify lists an overwhelming number of testimonials.

The objective? Make you feel that the product _is_ loved by many.

## Raycast's CTA Section

If you're building a tool for devs, it can make more sense to have a command instead of a CTA button.

## Stripe's Social Proof

One common practice when building landing pages is to _show the product._

Problem: how do you _show the product_ when you're building an API that's invisible by design?

Take Stripe. As a workaround, it shows the end-user experience.
