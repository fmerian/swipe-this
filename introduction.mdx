Hi, I'm [Flo](https://read.cv/fmerian). I do marketing at [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com).

This swipe file is my personal collection of marketing, growth, and UX ideas.

It includes pages, onboarding flows, docs, ads, and product updates from awesome dev-first companies like Resend, Stripe, Vercel, and more. So, if I'm struggling with creative work, I can refer to it for inspiration.
